**_QALB_** Language is a programming language in which you can code python in arabic language.

This is in completely basic and experimental stage.

Please see `احلاـوـسحلا` file for a sample file of code. 
> I apologize for any mistakes. And need your help in that.

`main.py` convert `احلاـوـسحلا`(arabic code) into `احلاـوـسحلا.py`(python code)

**مفيد** package contains few functions written in arabic which called python core functions.

As of now it contains only print function for the experiment purpose. 

This is a big project and I need your contribution. This can be used for other languages as well.

This has been tested on macOS 10.13.2 and PyCharm 2018.1 (Community Edition) and Visual Studio Code (1.25.1)

You can take a fork of this repo and can make change ot file * احلاـوـسحلا * and when you are done run

`python3 main.py احلاـوـسحلا`

and it will create a python file احلاـوـسحلا.py which you have to run manually for now

`python3 احلاـوـسحلا.py`
