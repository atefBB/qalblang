# لغة القلب [:blue_heart:] 
**_QALB_** Language is a completely open source programming language in which you can code python in arabic language.

This is in completely basic and experimental phase.

Please see `احلاـوـسحلا` file for a sample file of code. 
> I apologize for any mistakes. And need your help in that.

`main.py` convert `احلاـوـسحلا`(arabic code) into `احلاـوـسحلا.py`(python code)

**مفيد** package contains few functions written in arabic which called python core functions.

As of now it contains only print function for the experiment purpose. 

This is a big project and I need your contribution. This can be used for other languages as well.

This has been tested on macOS 10.13.2 and PyCharm 2018.1 (Community Edition) and Visual Studio Code (1.25.1)

You can take a fork of this repository and can make change to file * مرحبا * and when you are done run

`python3 main.py مرحبا`

and it will create a python file مرحبا.py which you have to run manually for now

`python3 مرحبا.py`

## Requirements

Python3 is required to compile the code.


## Installing
Clone this repository in a folder.
