**_QALB_** Language is a programming language in which you can code python in arabic language.

This is in completely basic and experimental stage.

Please see `احلاـوـسحلا` file for a sample file of code. 
> I apologize for any mistakes. And need your help in that.

`main.py` convert `احلاـوـسحلا`(arabic code) into `احلاـوـسحلا.py`(python code)

**مفيد** package contains few functions written in arabic which called python core functions.

As of now it contains only print function for the experiment purpose. 

This is a big project and I need your contribution. This can be used for other languages as well.

This has been tested on macOS 10.13.2 and PyCharm 2018.1 (Community Edition)
